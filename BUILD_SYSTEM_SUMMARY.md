# Sift-rs Build System Summary

This document summarizes the build system enhancements made to the sift-rs project to support multiple targets including server, library, and WASM builds.

## Build Scripts Created

### 1. Shell Script (`build.sh`)
A comprehensive bash script that handles building for all targets:
- Library builds
- Server binary builds
- WASM package builds (web, Node.js, bundler)
- Chat backend builds
- Web frontend builds

Features:
- Cross-platform compatibility (Unix-like systems)
- Modular build targets
- Clean builds option
- Verbose output mode
- Help documentation

Usage:
```bash
# Build everything
./build.sh

# Build specific targets
./build.sh -t lib          # Build only the library
./build.sh -t server       # Build only the server binary
./build.sh -t wasm         # Build only WASM packages
./build.sh -t chat         # Build only the chat backend
./build.sh -t web          # Build only the web frontend

# Clean before building
./build.sh -c

# See all options
./build.sh -h
```

### 2. PowerShell Script (`build.ps1`)
A PowerShell equivalent for Windows users with all the same functionality as the bash script.

Usage:
```powershell
# Build everything
.\build.ps1

# Build specific targets
.\build.ps1 -Type server
.\build.ps1 -Type wasm
.\build.ps1 -Type chat
```

### 3. Makefile
A traditional makefile for systems with make available.

Usage:
```bash
# Build all targets
make

# Build specific targets
make lib                 # Build the library
make server              # Build the server binary
make wasm                # Build all WASM packages
make wasm-web            # Build WASM for web
make wasm-nodejs         # Build WASM for Node.js
make wasm-bundler        # Build WASM for bundlers
make chat                # Build chat backend
make web                 # Build web frontend
make test                # Run tests
make bench               # Run benchmarks
make clean               # Clean build artifacts
```

## Build Targets Supported

### 1. Library Build
- Core sift-rs functionality
- All MongoDB operators including $where
- Zero-copy operations for performance
- WASM-compatible implementation using Boa JavaScript engine

### 2. Server Binary
- Standalone server with REST API
- All MongoDB operators including $where
- HTTP endpoints for query validation and execution
- CORS support for web applications

### 3. WASM Packages
Three different WASM build targets:
- **Web**: Optimized for browser environments
- **Node.js**: Compatible with Node.js applications
- **Bundler**: Ready for webpack, rollup, and other bundlers

All WASM builds include:
- Full MongoDB operator support
- $where operator using Boa JavaScript engine
- Zero-copy operations
- Bundle size optimization

### 4. Chat Backend
- WebSocket-based chat service
- AI integration with Groq API
- Real-time query assistance
- REST API fallback

### 5. Web Frontend
- Next.js web interface
- Query builder UI
- Real-time chat integration
- WASM-powered query execution

## Key Features

### Unified $where Implementation
- Uses Boa JavaScript engine for all builds (server, library, WASM)
- Consistent behavior across all platforms
- Improved performance compared to previous rustyscript implementation
- Full JavaScript expression evaluation support

### Conditional Compilation
- Feature-based compilation for different targets
- Server builds with Axum/Tokio dependencies
- WASM builds with web-sys/js-sys dependencies
- Library builds with minimal dependencies

### Performance Optimizations
- Pre-compiled filters for repeated operations
- Zero-copy operations where possible
- WASM-optimized builds
- Memory-efficient query processing

## Dependencies Management

### Core Dependencies
- `serde` and `serde_json` for JSON handling
- `regex` for pattern matching
- `chrono` for date/time operations

### Server Dependencies (optional)
- `axum` for web framework
- `tokio` for async runtime
- `tower` and `tower-http` for middleware

### WASM Dependencies (optional)
- `wasm-bindgen` for WASM bindings
- `js-sys` and `web-sys` for web APIs
- `boa_engine` for JavaScript evaluation

### Chat Backend Dependencies (optional)
- AI integration with Groq API
- WebSocket support
- Real-time communication

## Testing and Validation

All build targets are validated through:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for query operations
- Performance benchmarks
- WASM compatibility tests
- Cross-platform validation

## Usage Examples

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/username/sift-rs.git
cd sift-rs

# Build everything for development
./build.sh

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench

# Start development server
cargo run --bin sift-rs-server --features server
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Build optimized release versions
./build.sh -t server
./build.sh -t wasm

# Deploy WASM package to CDN
# Deploy server binary to production environment
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Clean build for CI
./build.sh -c -t all

# Run tests and generate reports
cargo test -- --format junit > test-results.xml
cargo bench -- --output-format bencher > benchmark-results.txt
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the build system:
- Automated release packaging
- Docker image builds
- Cross-compilation for multiple architectures
- Binary size optimization
- Additional WASM targets (e.g., WASI)
- Plugin system for custom operators
